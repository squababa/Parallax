ABSTRACT STRUCTURE TO FIND: {abstract_structure}
SEARCH RESULTS FROM OTHER FIELDS:
{search_results}

Strict rules:
- Look for a conserved causal structure, not shared topic words.
- A real structural match usually preserves the same driver -> mechanism -> outcome shape, with similar control logic.
- Strong structural clues include similar threshold behavior, routing, bottlenecks, feedback loops, switching conditions, or gating logic.
- Treat titles, provenance labels, and snippets as evidence, but weight concrete mechanism-bearing snippets more heavily than broad topical overlap or generic titles.
- If SEARCH RESULTS are grouped into candidate clusters, reason cluster-by-cluster and prefer the strongest coherent cluster over isolated snippet overlap.
- Approve only when one candidate domain shows one concrete target-domain process, one concrete shared constraint/mechanism, and one concrete workaround or operating response in the same evidence cluster.
- Approve only when the target domain shows both the shared causal structure and concrete evidence of an already engineered workaround, mitigation, or operating response to that constraint.
- Treat a concrete engineered intervention, operating adjustment, suppression/control response, or manipulated-condition change as valid solution-bearing evidence when it clearly manages the same constraint or failure mode.
- A paper can count as solution-bearing even without the literal word `workaround` if it shows one concrete target-domain intervention that changes the same bottleneck, failure mode, or control problem.
- Reject vague analogies, keyword overlap, and broad theme matches without similar causal organization.
- Reject universal principles that connect everything (generic feedback, emergence, optimization, networks).
- If multiple candidate domains appear, prefer the one with the clearest retrieved workaround or mitigation evidence.
- Do not treat broad process description, descriptive operating context, or mechanism background alone as solution evidence unless it includes one concrete operator-relevant intervention or engineered response.
- If the search results only restate the problem, constraint, or failure mode without concrete workaround evidence, return no_connection.

ABSTRACT STRUCTURE: {abstract_structure}
STAGE 1 DETECTION JSON:
{stage_one_json}
SEARCH RESULTS:
{search_results}
RELEVANT PRIOR FAILURE CONSTRAINTS:
{relevant_scars}

Requirements:
- Keep target_domain aligned with Stage 1.
- Ask the core retrieval-grounded question directly: which domain operated under this same constraint and engineered a working solution, what specific workaround or mitigation did it use, and how does that workaround translate into a concrete target-domain lever grounded in SEARCH RESULTS?
- If STAGE 1 DETECTION JSON includes `solution_evidence`, treat it as a required anchor for the working solution or workaround. Reuse that retrieved workaround evidence instead of inventing a different fix.
- If RELEVANT PRIOR FAILURE CONSTRAINTS are provided, treat them as hard cautionary constraints. Do not repeat the same failure mode unless the retrieved target evidence specifically overcomes it.
- Lock onto exactly one primary target-domain causal claim before elaborating the comparison.
- Final candidate wording must read like a concise operator briefing, not an analogy, essay, or literature summary.
- Prefer short, direct sentences. Prefer explicit operators, metrics, comparators, and decisions over abstract connective filler.
- Reduce analogy-style phrasing, decorative transitions, and explanatory padding. State the claim and mechanism directly.
- The primary target-domain claim must be no broader than the retrieved target-domain evidence. Do not generalize beyond what the target snippets directly support.
- If the search results support only a narrow, local, conditional, or partial version of the claim, make that narrower version the core claim.
- Prefer the smaller honest claim over the broader impressive one. Do not reward elegant analogy shells that outrun the retrieved target evidence.
- Keep the workaround, mitigation, or engineered operating response grounded in retrieved target-domain evidence. Do not invent a fix that is not supported in SEARCH RESULTS or STAGE 1 DETECTION JSON.
- That primary claim must name one measurable target-domain operator or operator-driven outcome that can be checked in literature or experiments.
- If the target material does not directly support a concrete target-domain claim at that level, return `no_connection`.
- The first-pass Stage 2 output should already satisfy required-field checks without relying on repair. If any field would be generic, missing, or placeholder-like, rewrite it concretely now or return `no_connection`.
- `connection`, `mechanism`, `prediction`, and `test` must all stay centered on that same primary claim. If they drift to different effects or outcomes, return `no_connection`.
- `edge_analysis.problem_statement`, `edge_analysis.actionable_lever`, `edge_analysis.cheap_test`, and `edge_analysis.edge_if_right` must stay centered on that same primary claim, process, comparator, and metric. Do not let the edge layer introduce a different operator problem or a second target outcome.
- Explain one concrete shared mechanism, not a metaphor.
- Provide variable_mapping with at least 3 mapped variables.
- Order variable_mapping so the first 3 mappings are the strongest-supported critical mappings. If more mappings are included, put weaker or less direct ones after those first 3.
- If the retrieved target evidence only cleanly supports 3 critical mappings, keep variable_mapping to exactly those 3 instead of padding in weaker broad mappings.
- Provide `mechanism_type` using exactly one tag from this controlled v1 vocabulary:
  {mechanism_vocab}
- Provide `mechanism_type_confidence` as a numeric value in the 0.00-1.00 range.
- Optional `secondary_mechanism_types` must be a JSON array and every tag must also come from the same controlled vocabulary.
- Provide evidence_map with claim-level evidence:
  - evidence_map.variable_mappings must cover each critical mapping in variable_mapping (at least 3 entries).
- Each variable mapping entry must include source_variable, target_variable, claim, evidence_snippet, source_reference, and may include support_level.
- The first 3 variable_mapping entries are the critical mappings, so the first 3 evidence_map.variable_mappings entries must be the strongest-supported ones and must align to those same critical mappings.
- For each critical mapping, the claim must closely match the mapped variables, the evidence_snippet must directly support that exact claim, and the source_reference must point to the specific search result containing that snippet.
- For critical mappings, write the claim as a direct restatement of what the evidence_snippet literally supports. Do not let the claim become broader, more abstract, or more mechanistic than the snippet itself.
- For the first 3 critical mappings, keep the claim as a narrow paraphrase of the snippet and reuse concrete target-domain wording from the snippet where possible.
- For critical mappings, prefer direct support over inferential support whenever possible.
- For the first 3 critical mappings, make each mapping narrow, directly supported, aligned to the mapped variables, and stated at the same specificity as the snippet itself.
- For the first 3 critical mappings, the evidence_snippet must be specific enough to stand on its own: prefer 8+ words, at least one or two concrete overlapping terms with the claim/mapped variable, and enough local detail that it does not read like generic background context.
- Prefer exactly 3 strong critical mappings over padded weak mappings. If support is thin, keep the first 3 mappings narrow and well-supported instead of inventing broader weak critical mappings. Non-critical mappings are lower priority.
  - If a snippet supports only a weaker, local correspondence, keep the mapping claim equally weak and local.
  - Write each claim at the same level of specificity as the mapped variables. Do not make the claim broader than the mapping itself.
  - Each variable mapping snippet must directly bear on the mapped target-domain variable, not just the broader target-domain story or a nearby downstream effect.
  - Do not use vague evidence_snippet text that only supports the broader domain, the general story, or the overall mechanism.
  - Do not cite a broad mechanism sentence as support for a narrow variable-level mapping.
  - Do not pad the first 3 mappings with abstract correspondences or nearby-but-not-exact analogs just to reach 3.
  - For the first 3 critical mappings, choose snippets that mention the mapped variable, threshold, process, or operator directly when possible.
  - If exact support is unavailable, weaken or omit the mapping rather than overstating what the snippet proves.
  - If fewer than 3 mappings are directly supportable at that narrow variable level, return `no_connection`.
  - If a snippet only supports the overall causal story but not the exact mapped-variable claim, use it for mechanism_assertions instead of variable_mappings.
  - If a snippet only supports mechanism-level logic without a direct variable-level claim, put it in `mechanism_assertions`, not in `variable_mappings`.
  - evidence_map.mechanism_assertions must include at least 1 entry with mechanism_claim, evidence_snippet, and source_reference.
  - mechanism_assertions must be concise mechanism-support statements tied to the same target-domain process named in `mechanism`, not broad literature-summary assertions.
  - mechanism_assertions must support the actual causal operator or control logic in the mechanism (what triggers, routes, switches, inhibits, amplifies, or accumulates), not just background context about the target domain.
  - At least one target-domain snippet or mechanism_assertion must directly support the named target-domain process or the exact metric/immediate observable consequence used in the test.
  - Treat the evidence_snippet itself as the core proof. Do not let mechanism_claim carry stronger process language than the snippet actually supports.
  - Do not use broad field summaries, adjacent background explanation, or generic literature framing as `mechanism_assertions`.
  - For the core claim, prefer one direct target-domain snippet that explicitly names the same process noun phrase or the same canonical test metric. If you only have adjacent context, background explanation, or broad domain framing, return `no_connection`.
  - If the mechanism cannot be directly supported by a target-domain snippet or a concise mechanism_assertion on that same process, return `no_connection`.
  - Prefer direct core target evidence over broad contextual target evidence. A weaker overview-style snippet should never be the main support if a narrower direct mechanism or metric snippet is available.
  - For the named target-domain process, `test.metric`, and the first 3 critical mappings, prefer scholarly, technical, primary, standards, or otherwise domain-credible target evidence when available.
  - Reject off-domain or generic background target evidence. If a result title or evidence_snippet is not clearly about the target domain, named process, or named metric, treat it as unusable and return `no_connection`.
  - Treat generic blogs, broad explainers, hobbyist pages, or weakly related overviews as weak evidence for the core target-domain process or metric. Do not use them as the main grounding for the core claim if reasonably domain-appropriate evidence is unavailable; return `no_connection` instead.
  - If a target result title or snippet is only loosely related or obviously lower-quality than needed for the named process or metric, treat it as weak evidence and do not anchor the core claim on it.
  - Keep evidence_snippet short and grounded in SEARCH RESULTS. Use a result title or URL for source_reference. Do not invent sources.
- Provide `prediction` as a structured object with these keys:
  observable, time_horizon, direction, magnitude, confidence,
  falsification_condition, utility_rationale, who_benefits.
- Provide a falsifiable test with metric + confirm + falsify.
- A compelling comparison is not sufficient. If you cannot tie the hypothesis to one measurable target-domain operator or operator-driven outcome, return `no_connection`.
- `test.metric` must name one concrete measurable metric explicitly. Use a standard reported metric name where possible, and keep it specific enough that a paper table, figure, or abstract result could report it directly.
- `test.metric` must not use generic outcome placeholders such as `performance`, `efficiency`, `quality`, `improvement`, or `stability`.
- If you cannot ground one specific `test.metric` from retrieved evidence or the strongest target-domain snippet wording, return `no_connection` instead of writing a vague metric.
- `prediction.observable`, `test.metric`, `test.confirm`, and `test.falsify` must all evaluate the same named target-domain operator or its direct measurable outcome, with the same primary comparator.
- `test.confirm` and `test.falsify` must each refer to that same named metric and its explicit comparator. Do not write vague test language like "check whether the effect happens."
- Good confirm/falsify wording names the metric directly. Examples:
  - `collision rate per hyperperiod is lower under filtered scheduling than under sequential scheduling at equal utilization`
  - `mean cascade size per initiating branch failure does not differ between high-load and low-load configurations`
- Bad confirm/falsify wording is generic. Examples:
  - `the effect happens`
  - `results improve`
- Do not pair a broad analogy with a loosely related metric. If the metric only weakly proxies the claimed mechanism, narrow the claim or return `no_connection`.
- The mechanism field must name one specific causal process centered on the single primary causal operator that actually drives the analogy, not a broad analogy or generic system description.
- The mechanism sentence must name a specific target-domain process that is directly evidenced in the retrieved target material or mechanism assertions.
- The first clause of `mechanism` must open with the named target-domain process noun phrase itself, not with a consequence sentence, threshold/result summary, or broad pattern description.
- `mechanism` must open with exactly one target-domain process noun phrase and then follow with one explicit causal chain in target-domain terms: process/operator -> control, trigger, comparator, or bottleneck variable -> resulting measurable change.
- Open `mechanism` with the exact target-domain process noun phrase used in the strongest supporting evidence snippet, or a very close paraphrase of that wording.
- Do not open `mechanism` with broad framing such as `In this domain`, `The system`, `This process`, or `A mechanism where`.
- Do not bridge into the process with wording like `operates by`, `works by`, `functions by`, or `acts by` when the process noun phrase itself is already available in the target evidence.
- Do not use generic similarity wording in `mechanism` such as `mirrors`, `is analogous to`, `resembles`, `similar to`, or `shares dynamics with`.
- Do not rename the target-domain process into a broader abstract label. If the evidence says `offset assignment`, `mode switching`, `atrial event detection`, or `token bucket refill saturation`, start from that wording.
- The first clause should read like: `[specific target-domain process] [acts on/monitors/routes/tests] [control or monitored quantity]`, then state the discrete or measurable change that process causes.
- Name the operative process itself, not an abstract pattern behind it. Do not stop at generic labels like threshold crossing, feedback loop, accumulation, switching, or competition without the target-domain process that performs that action.
- Do not upgrade generic threshold, redundancy, routing, competition, or feedback language into a stronger target-domain mechanism unless the retrieved target evidence directly supports that stronger process claim.
- The mechanism must name the exact target-domain process that `test.metric` is supposed to measure.
- `test.metric`, `test.confirm`, and `test.falsify` must directly measure that named process or its immediate observable consequence, not a distant downstream proxy.
- Prefer a process name or standard causal operator a target-domain paper might use (for example: `SERCA-mediated SR refilling`, `GABAergic lateral inhibition`, `zero-cross switching`, `frictional contact network formation`).
- Prefer a process term already present in target evidence, mechanism assertions, or standard target-domain literature wording.
- Good mechanism openings:
  - `interval-by-interval atrial event detection counts sensed atrial events against the mode-switch cutoff, triggering ventricular tracking suppression`
  - `predicate subsumption test for cache reuse compares the incoming predicate to cached predicate sets, skipping recomputation when containment holds`
- Unacceptable mechanism naming includes generic placeholders such as `a threshold mechanism`, `a gating effect`, `a competitive dynamic`, or `a self-reinforcing process`.
- Unacceptable mechanism openings also include result-first phrasing such as `when a threshold is crossed...`, `feedback causes escalation...`, or `the system transitions to...` before naming the process.
- Bad mechanism openings:
  - `threshold crossing triggers suppression`
  - `a feedback loop increases reuse`
- If you cannot name a process already grounded in target-domain evidence or literature-facing wording, return `no_connection`.
- If the named process cannot be grounded in target evidence or mechanism assertions, return `no_connection`.
- If the target search results do not directly support a concrete target-domain process, return `no_connection` instead of filling the gap with generic mechanism language.
- If you can describe only a pattern, threshold crossing, or transition but cannot name the operative target-domain process in target-domain terms, return `no_connection`.
- In `mechanism`, explicitly state:
  - the operative causal operator,
  - the control, trigger, threshold, comparator, or bottleneck variable,
  - and the resulting state transition, failure mode, or measurable outcome.
- If you cannot name one operative causal process with its control or trigger variable and resulting state transition, return `no_connection` instead of writing a broad analogy-only mechanism.
- If multiple processes are present, choose the dominant operator as the main mechanism and treat other processes as boundary conditions, assumptions, or brief secondary notes. Do not merge background processes into the primary mechanism.
- The mechanism field must use causal language: explain what drives, causes, regulates, inhibits, amplifies, couples, transfers, or converts what. Describe the primary causal operator, not just a resemblance.
- Make `mechanism` process-level and falsifiable. Avoid metaphorical summaries or generic "things interact" language.
- Do not write `mechanism` as only analogy, resemblance, or high-level summary. It must state a concrete process that could be tested against alternatives.
- Do not claim structural identity or a strong mechanism match when the systems only share broad vocabulary, loose dynamics, or superficially similar outcomes.
- Do not elevate a supporting or background dynamic into the primary mechanism. If the analogy depends on a fragile hidden assumption that is likely to fail under adversarial scrutiny, weaken the claim substantially or return `no_connection`.
- Bad mechanism fields include:
  - "both systems involve complex interactions"
  - "both optimize under constraints"
  - "both exhibit adaptation"
  - "both use feedback"
- Bad mechanism matches also include:
  - same threshold vocabulary but different underlying trigger or operator
  - same bottleneck language but different causal limiter
  - same feedback language but different control loop structure
  - same phase-transition language but equilibrium versus driven-transition mismatch
  unless the mechanism also names a specific process and control logic.
- Prefer a smaller, narrower, more defensible mechanism claim over a broad impressive claim that is likely to fail adversarially. Precision of causal correspondence matters more than scope.
- If several mechanism-to-test framings are possible, choose the single framing with the cleanest measurable target-domain operator and the clearest one-result-family test.
- Make `prediction` literature-resolvable: phrase it so a paper abstract or results section could directly support or contradict it.
- Prefer one measurable outcome and one primary comparison condition over multiple coupled outcomes or several linked claims.
- Make the observable explicit and concrete. Name the measurable variable, metric, population, intervention, comparator, or context when those details matter for checking the claim against external evidence.
- Prefer canonical literature-facing metric names already used in the target-domain search results or standard papers. Use common reported terms (for example, false-positive rate, hazard ratio, burst probability, SPL in dB, odds ratio, correlation coefficient) instead of bespoke paraphrases when an established metric exists.
- Make the comparison phrasing explicit and simple. Prefer exactly one primary comparator such as before/after, treatment/control, lower or higher than baseline, or "as X increases, Y decreases."
- State one expected directional outcome using the current schema's directional comparison words (`increase`, `decrease`, `higher`, or `lower`). Even narrower or cleaner predictions must still populate `prediction.direction` with one of those directional terms.
- Phrase the prediction so it reads like a paper abstract result sentence, figure caption, reported trend, correlation, or threshold comparison.
- Prefer predictions that one paper abstract, one figure, or one reported result trend could directly support or contradict on their own.
- Avoid predictions that require several linked observations, multiple distinct subclaims, latent-variable inference, or combined curve-shape assumptions before they count as validated.
- If a prediction could be written either as one direct reported comparison or as a compound story, choose the one direct reported comparison.
- Avoid decorative, elegant, or idiosyncratic wording when a standard measurable phrasing would be more likely to appear in an abstract or results section.
- Avoid overloaded prediction sentences that stack threshold behavior, monotonicity, saturation, timing, and mechanism in one claim unless each part is essential and jointly testable from the same result family.
- Prefer narrower predictions that can be falsified or supported by one literature result family over elegant but broad claims that only retrieve domain-adjacent evidence.
- The prediction must include a measurable observable, a time horizon, a falsification condition, and why the prediction is useful.
- Provide `edge_analysis` as a grounded operator layer tied to the exact same primary target-domain claim as `connection`, `mechanism`, `prediction`, and `test`.
- `edge_analysis.problem_statement` must name exactly one specific target-domain problem, blind spot, hidden failure mode, or missed control point.
- `edge_analysis.problem_statement` must describe exactly one hidden or underexploited operational problem, not a broad summary of the field.
- Tie `edge_analysis.problem_statement` to the same process, the same metric/comparator, and the same operator decision already used in `prediction` / `test`.
- Make `edge_analysis.problem_statement` read like a missed operator problem, not an essay.
- Reject field-summary prose, restatements of the whole domain, and generic `systems are complex` wording in `edge_analysis.problem_statement`.
- `edge_analysis.actionable_lever` must name exactly one concrete operator move, setting change, filter, routing rule, threshold adjustment, replay, audit, or workflow intervention that follows from the mechanism.
- `edge_analysis.actionable_lever` must reuse the current mechanism, metric, or operator context. Do not write advisory phrasing like `consider`, `explore`, `may help`, `investigate`, or other non-operational wording.
- Reject vague levers such as `investigate further`, `optimize process`, `improve monitoring`, or `apply insights`.
- `edge_analysis.cheap_test` must be one cheap operator-facing check on an existing workflow slice and must include setup, metric, confirm, falsify, and time_to_signal. It must be a fast realistic validation path, not a multi-month research program by default.
- `edge_analysis.cheap_test.setup` must read like one real operator move on a narrow slice of the target-domain workflow. Name one real operator move, dataset, simulation, or measurement path, reuse the same process, comparator, and metric from `mechanism`/`prediction`/`test`, and make the setup smaller, cheaper, and more decision-facing than the main test.
- `edge_analysis.cheap_test.metric` must stay aligned with `test.metric`; name the same measurable quantity or a narrow comparator on that same quantity, not a generic proxy.
- `edge_analysis.cheap_test.metric` must not drift into generic validation wording or a broad proxy metric.
- `edge_analysis.cheap_test` must not merely restate `test.data` or say to validate the hypothesis. Avoid generic wording like `run a study`, `validate the hypothesis`, `collect more data`, or `see if the effect appears`. A good cheap test sounds like replaying one queue, filtering one candidate set, toggling one threshold, auditing one failure bucket, or comparing one narrow before/after operator intervention.
- `edge_analysis.edge_if_right` must state one concrete operator advantage if the test confirms the claim. Keep it contingent and scoped to the retrieved evidence.
- `edge_analysis.edge_if_right` must name exactly one operator, one decision change unlocked by the cheap test, and one concrete advantage if confirmed, not just say the result would be useful.
- `edge_analysis.edge_if_right` must say what the operator will do differently if the cheap test confirms, not just that the result has novelty or value.
- `edge_analysis.edge_if_right` must explicitly say who acts, what they do differently, and what concrete advantage they gain if confirmed.
- `edge_analysis.edge_if_right` must stay concise and operator-facing, with no extra generic value framing before or after the operator decision.
- Do not use generic novelty or value phrasing in `edge_analysis.edge_if_right` such as `this could be useful`, `this may provide an edge`, `novel insight`, or `valuable perspective`.
- Keep `edge_analysis.actionable_lever`, `edge_analysis.cheap_test`, and `edge_analysis.edge_if_right` tied to the same operator and the same metric/comparator. Do not let the lever, cheap test, and edge consequence point to different workflow slices or different success criteria.
- `edge_analysis.primary_operator` must name the specific operator who would use the lever.
- `edge_analysis.why_missed` must explain one concrete search, framing, workflow, metric, or discipline-boundary reason the target-domain problem or lever may be undernoticed.
- `edge_analysis.expected_asymmetry` must explain why the lever is plausibly underused rather than already standard target-domain wisdom.
- `edge_analysis.deployment_scope` should name where to try it first.
- Package the edge layer like an operator handoff: one hidden problem, one concrete lever, one cheap test, and one decision change if the cheap test confirms.
- Keep `edge_analysis.problem_statement`, `edge_analysis.actionable_lever`, `edge_analysis.cheap_test`, and `edge_analysis.edge_if_right` tight and operational. Avoid analogy-heavy framing, literature-summary phrasing, and padded connective filler.
- If the retrieved target-domain snippets already state the problem and lever in normal target-domain language as standard practice, best practice, or obvious operator guidance, return `no_connection` instead of wrapping it in cross-domain language.
- Keep underexploitedness claims retrieval-scoped and honest. `rarely searched`, `cross-silo`, `hidden by default workflow`, or `screened out by standard framing` are acceptable. `nobody knows this` or `unpublished` are not.
- Good problem statements name one concrete hidden failure mode tied to the same metric or observable and to one operator decision. Examples:
  - `Dense periodic schedulers may miss collision-free non-sequential offset assignments before greedy slot commitment, inflating collision rate at high utilization.`
  - `Doorway-capacity models may overestimate marginal throughput above the saturation threshold, causing planners to keep dwell-time assumptions that fail under crowding.`
- Bad problem statements are generic or essay-like. Examples:
  - `Complex systems may hide inefficiencies.`
  - `This domain may have an interesting blind spot.`
- Good actionable levers name one concrete operator action or design choice. Examples:
  - `Add a siteswap-style validity filter before greedy slot assignment.`
  - `Switch doorway-capacity planning from linear throughput assumptions to threshold-based capacity rules above the saturation point.`
- Bad actionable levers are vague or advisory. Examples:
  - `Investigate further.`
  - `Use this perspective to think differently about the system.`
- Good cheap tests sound like real operator moves on the same metric. Examples:
  - `Replay one week of dense scheduling logs with the validity filter turned on before slot assignment and compare collision rate per hyperperiod against the existing scheduler on the same workloads.`
  - `Rerank one triage queue with the threshold gate enabled and compare false-positive rate against the current rule on the same cases.`
- Bad cheap tests are generic validation suggestions or full restatements of the main test. Examples:
  - `Run a study to validate whether the hypothesis is true.`
  - `Collect more data and see if the effect appears.`
  - `Use the main experiment described above.`
- Good test metrics name one concrete literature-facing quantity. Examples:
  - `collision rate per hyperperiod`
  - `mean cascade size per initiating branch failure`
  - `false-positive rate`
- Bad test metrics are generic placeholders. Examples:
  - `performance`
  - `overall efficiency`
  - `outcomes`
- Good edge advantages name one concrete operator gain, one decision change, and one concrete advantage. Examples:
  - `A real-time scheduling engineer can keep the validity filter in the scheduler when the replay lowers collision rate, reducing collisions before redesigning the scheduling architecture.`
  - `A transit planner can cap dwell-time assumptions above the saturation point when the audit confirms the plateau, avoiding overestimated doorway throughput in station plans.`
- Bad edge advantages are generic usefulness claims. Examples:
  - `This could be useful.`
  - `This may provide an edge.`
- Good direct core target evidence explicitly names the same process or metric used in `mechanism` or `test.metric`. Examples:
  - `Automatic mode switching compares the detected atrial rate with a programmable cutoff and switches to a non-tracking mode when the cutoff is exceeded.`
  - `Feasible schedules are constructed by assigning offsets that satisfy collision-avoidance constraints across the hyperperiod.`
- Bad direct core target evidence is only adjacent context or broad framing. Examples:
  - `The article discusses how scheduling matters in real-time systems.`
  - `The paper explains why mode switching is important in device management.`
- Good `why_missed` explanations name one concrete reason the idea may be undernoticed. Examples:
  - `Scheduling teams usually search scheduling heuristics within scheduling literature, not combinatorial juggling notation, so this filter is cross-silo.`
  - `Doorway planning workflows often assume smooth throughput scaling and may not explicitly test for a plateau regime.`
- Bad `why_missed` explanations are generic or evasive. Examples:
  - `People may miss this.`
  - `This is underexplored.`
- Good `expected_asymmetry` explanations justify why the lever is underused. Examples:
  - `The lever is plausibly underused because siteswap validity constraints are rarely framed as scheduling candidate filters in real-time systems tooling.`
  - `The edge comes from testing a threshold regime that standard dwell-time planning treats as linear.`
- Bad `expected_asymmetry` explanations either sound generic or admit the idea is already standard. Examples:
  - `This could create an edge.`
  - `This is already standard practice in the target domain.`
- Do not write generic edge language such as `this could help researchers`, `investigate further`, `monitor this`, or `this may provide an edge`.
- Do not claim `nobody knows this`, `this is unpublished`, or similar novelty claims as fact.
- If you cannot supply a specific problem, actionable lever, cheap test, and contingent edge without unsupported extrapolation, return `no_connection`.
- If `mechanism`, `test.metric`, `test.confirm`, `test.falsify`, `edge_analysis.problem_statement`, `edge_analysis.actionable_lever`, `edge_analysis.edge_if_right`, `edge_analysis.why_missed`, `edge_analysis.expected_asymmetry`, or the first 3 critical evidence snippets are only generic placeholders, rewrite them concretely or return `no_connection`.
- Provide at least 2 assumptions and explicit boundary_conditions.

- Avoid the source domain and source category names.
- Avoid vague generic wording and token soup.
- Reject formal logic/query-language phrasing like `AND`, `OR`, `verification`, or `alignment` when it is not part of a real mechanism phrase anchor.

Repair only the listed fields. Keep `source_domain`, `target_domain`, `connection`, `prediction`, `test`, `variable_mapping`, `evidence_map`, `boundary_conditions`, `assumptions`, and mechanism typing stable unless one of the listed fields must change to satisfy the repair.

Phase 6 rules:
- This candidate already scored well enough to deserve one narrow rescue pass. Do not broaden the claim, add new unsupported mechanisms, or relax evidence discipline.
- Prefer the smallest valid rewrite that clears the listed blockers. A narrow honest repair is better than a broad rewrite that drifts or fails validation.
- Rewrite toward concise operator-briefing prose: short direct sentences, explicit operator/metric/decision language, minimal connective filler.
- Remove analogy-heavy phrasing, literature-summary framing, and decorative explanation. Keep the claim concrete and operational.
- If `mechanism` is listed, rewrite it to open with one exact target-domain process noun phrase pulled from the strongest direct target-domain evidence.
- If `mechanism` is listed, do not open with broad bridges like `operates by`, `works by`, `functions by`, or analogy-heavy framing when a concrete process noun phrase is available.
- If only `mechanism` is listed, keep the edge layer and test language unchanged. Fix the anchor, not the whole story.
- If only `mechanism` is listed, you may return a JSON object containing only the repaired `mechanism` field.
- If any edge-analysis fields are listed, rewrite `edge_analysis.problem_statement`, `edge_analysis.actionable_lever`, `edge_analysis.cheap_test`, and `edge_analysis.edge_if_right` together so they stay on the same claim, process, comparator, and metric already grounded by `mechanism` / `prediction` / `test`.
- When rewriting the edge layer, reuse the same observable, metric, comparator, and operator-decision language already present in `prediction` / `test`. Reduce drift by reusing those exact anchor phrases instead of loose paraphrases.
- When rewriting the edge layer, package `edge_analysis.problem_statement` as one hidden operational problem, `edge_analysis.actionable_lever` as one concrete operator move or design choice, `edge_analysis.cheap_test` as one cheap operator check, and `edge_analysis.edge_if_right` as one operator decision consequence if confirmed.
- Preserve the current claim, process, metric, comparator, and operator while sharpening the wording. Do not broaden the field summary, invent a new lever, or introduce a different benefit axis.
- `edge_analysis.cheap_test` must describe one real operator move on a narrow slice of workflow, not a generic validation suggestion and not a restatement of the full test.
- If you cannot repair the listed fields without inventing unsupported detail, return `{"no_connection": true}`.
