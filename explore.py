EXTRACT_PROMPT = """You are a pattern extraction engine. Your job is to extract up to 5 transferable, mechanism-level patterns from a domain.
Domain: {domain}

What counts as a strong pattern:
- It captures a specific relationship, mechanism, or dynamic from the domain.
- It names a recognizable causal process, not a theme or topic area.
- It can be rewritten without domain vocabulary and still preserve structure.
- It is searchable in unrelated fields using neutral terms.
- It would help a later search detect a concrete control, routing, accumulation, threshold, bottleneck, feedback, or phase-change mechanism.
- It contains a concrete driver, an operative mechanism, and a resulting system behavior.
- It names at least one measurable variable or state change and, when possible, one controllable lever or intervention point.
- It would give a later jump stage something an operator could monitor, tune, gate, route, throttle, filter, or compare.

Prefer patterns in families like:
- threshold switching
- accumulation and release
- competition for constrained channels
- spatial routing or bottlenecks
- feedback stabilization or destabilization
- periodic reset under disturbance

Few-shot examples:
GOOD (from "Ant Colony Foraging")
- pattern_name: Pheromone-weighted path reinforcement
- description: Ant traffic amplifies route choice via local pheromone deposition and decay, creating rapid convergence to efficient paths under changing constraints.
- abstract_structure: Agents repeatedly choose among options using a shared, decaying memory field; each traversal increases local preference strength, producing positive feedback tempered by evaporation.
- search_query: decaying reinforcement path selection
Why GOOD: specific mechanism, explicit dynamics (deposit + decay), and transferable control logic.

BAD (from "Ribosome Translation")
- pattern_name: Protein synthesis sequence
- description: Ribosomes read mRNA codons to build proteins.
- abstract_structure: A system reads instructions in order.
- search_query: sequential instruction processing
Why BAD: mostly restates domain facts, abstract form is too generic, and query will retrieve broad computing/education material rather than a specific mechanism.

GOOD (from "Ribosome Translation")
- pattern_name: Triplet-coded error-tolerant decoding
- description: Translation maps fixed-width codon units to amino acids with redundancy that dampens point-mutation impact on resulting proteins.
- abstract_structure: A finite alphabet is decoded in fixed-size chunks through a many-to-one lookup, where neighborhood redundancy reduces output sensitivity to single-symbol perturbations.
- search_query: fixed width redundant decoding robustness
- measurable_signal: output error rate under single-symbol perturbation
- control_lever: chunk width or code redundancy
- transfer_rationale: maps to any system where fixed-size encoded inputs are decoded under noise and robustness depends on redundancy structure
Why GOOD: concrete encoding/decoding structure, measurable robustness property, and non-domain-specific abstract form.

BAD (from "Ant Colony Foraging")
- pattern_name: Collective intelligence
- description: Ants work together and self-organize.
- abstract_structure: Many simple agents produce complex behavior.
- search_query: emergence in multi agent systems
Why BAD: universal principle with no distinctive mechanism.

Rules:
- Avoid universal catch-alls (feedback, emergence, adaptation, optimization, generic networks) unless tightly parameterized and distinctive.
- Prefer explicit process constraints, measurable relationships, and mechanism details.
- Prefer patterns in families like thresholding, gating, accumulation-and-release, queueing, routing, bottlenecking, delayed feedback, inhibition, saturation, switching, selective filtering, or coupled control.
- pattern_name should name the mechanism, not the subject area. Avoid vague names like "adaptive behavior", "balance", "interaction effects", or "coordination".
- description should say what changes, through what process, and what outcome follows.
- abstract_structure should state a driver, the operative mechanism, and the resulting system behavior.
- abstract_structure should include a controllable trigger, bottleneck, comparator, queue, threshold, filter, routing rule, or measurable state variable whenever the source material supports it.
- abstract_structure must use zero domain-specific terminology.
- search_query must be 3-6 words and should avoid terms likely to retrieve the original domain.
- search_query should include the distinctive mechanism tokens that would help retrieve an unrelated analogue, not broad textbook language.
- measurable_signal should name one metric, threshold, rate, count, error mode, load measure, or state variable that a target-domain operator could plausibly check.
- control_lever should name one concrete operator action, tuning knob, gating rule, scheduling choice, routing decision, filter, or intervention implied by the mechanism.
- transfer_rationale should say why the process shape can transfer across domains without reverting to domain-specific nouns.
- Reject patterns that collapse to generic statements like "systems adapt to change", "multiple forces interact", or "local averaging occurs".
- Exclude patterns that are merely "things interact", "system adapts", "resources balance", or other broad abstractions without a concrete causal operator.
- Exclude patterns that are descriptive but non-operational: historical summaries, aesthetic motifs, symbolic readings, subject-area overviews, or taxonomic restatements.
- Exclude patterns that are elegant but unusable because they lack a measurable variable, controllable lever, or concrete process operator.
- Fewer patterns is better than weak patterns; return 1-5 patterns only if each one is mechanistically specific and transferable.
- Prefer 1-3 strong patterns over 4-5 mixed patterns.
- If a candidate cannot be expressed as a distinct mechanism with a concrete operator, omit it.
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown, no extra text.
